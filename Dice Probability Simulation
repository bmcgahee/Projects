#Title: Dice Probability Simulation
#Purpose: This program is a dice simulation that asks the user how many rolls he or she wants to do.
#The program rolls the dice that number of times, total up the number of times a certain number has been rolled,
#and calculates the probability of each number that has been rolled.

#Import the random module
import random

#Asks the user how many rolls.
rolls = int(raw_input("How many rolls? "))

#Initialize totals array.
totals = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

#For loop for to get the totals for all rolls and stores them in the totals array.
for i in range(1, rolls + 1):
    die_1 = random.randint(1, 6)
    die_2 = random.randint(1, 6)
    dice_total = die_1 + die_2
    totals[dice_total] += 1

#For loop to calculate how many times a number has been rolled, and calculates the probability of each number rolled.
for i in range(2, 13):
    print "total", i, "came up", totals[i], "times"
    d = (totals[i]/float(rolls))*100
    prob = '%.3f' % d
    print "The chances of rolling a ", i, "is ", prob + "%"
