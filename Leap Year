def leapyear(year):
    #Case when the year is divisible by 4
    if year % 4 == 0:
        #If year is divisible by both 100 and 400, then it is a leap year.
        if year % 100 == 0 and year % 400 == 0:
            return True
        #If year is not divisible by 100 then it is a leap year.
        elif year % 100 != 0:
            return True
        #Otherwise, it is not a leap year.
        else:
            return False
    else:
        #If the year is not divisible by 4, then it is not a leap year.
