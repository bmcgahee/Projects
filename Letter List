#Purpose:  Program asks user to select a letter from the alphabet.
#If the selected letter belongs to the letters list, then the program tells the user that the letter exists in the list.
#Otherwise, the program tells the user the letter does not exist in the list.

#List of letters a through e
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
#Program asks the user to select a letter
letter = raw_input("Select a letter from the alphabet: ")
#If user selected more than one character or letter then this error message is displayed.
if len(letter) > 1:
    print "you selected too many characters or selected character(s) that are not in the alphabet"
else:
    #If the letter is found in the letters list, then the program tells the user the letter is found.
    if letter in letters:
        print "found " + letter + " in letters"
    else:
        #If the letter is not found in the letter list, then the program tells the user the letter is not found.
