#Purpose:  This simple GUI program simulates the famous Magic 8 Ball that is sold in toy stores.
#Ask the Magic 8 Ball yes or no questions, shake it, and then it will provide you with a random answer.  

#Import the random, time, and easygui modules.
import random
import time
import easygui as e

#Magic 8 Ball list of potential answers.
magicEightBall = ["Yes", "No", "Maybe", "Don't even count on it!", "No way!", "You can't be serious!", "Not even close.", "You betcha!"]

#Asks the user to input a yes or no question.
question = e.enterbox("Ask a yes or no question:")

#answer stores the Magic 8 Ball's random answer to the question asked.
answer = random.choice(magicEightBall)

#Asks the user to share the Magic 8 Ball.  
shake = e.msgbox("Please shake the Magic 8 Ball")

#5 second delay
time.sleep(5)

#Displays the Magic 8 Ball's answer to the question.
finalAnswer = e.msgbox(answer)

#Ask the user if he or she would like to ask another question.
askAgain = e.enterbox("Would you like to ask another queston?")

#While loop executes if the answer is yes or Yes.
#User continues to ask questions to the Magic 8 Ball as long as they agree to ask another question.
while askAgain == "yes" or askAgain == "Yes":
    question = e.enterbox("Ask a yes or no question:")
    answer = random.choice(magicEightBall)
    shake = e.msgbox("Please shake the Magic 8 Ball")
    time.sleep(5)
    finalAnswer = e.msgbox(answer)
    askAgain = e.enterbox("Would you like to ask another question?")
    
#Displays a thank you message when the user is finished playing with the Magic 8 Ball.
e.msgbox("Thank you for using the Magic 8 Ball!")
