#Title: Names
#Purpose:  This program asks the user to enter in five names, and then asks which name it wants to replace 
#by entering in a number between 1-5, where 1 is the first name, 2 is the second name, 3 is the third name,
#4 is the fourth name, and 5 is the fifth name.  The user enters in the new name and the list of names is
#updated with the new name.

#Initalize empty names list
names = []

#User is prompted to enter 5 names
print "Enter 5 names (press the Enter key after each name): "

#For loop asks the user to enter 5 names and each name is appended to the list
for i in range(5):
    name = raw_input()
    names.append(name)
    
#prints out the 5 names
print "The names are ", names

#User is asked which name to be replace
replace_name = int(raw_input("Replace one name.  Which one? (1-5): "))

#While loop executes if the user does not enter in a number between 1 and 5
while replace_name != 1 and replace_name != 2 and replace_name != 3 and replace_name != 4 and replace_name != 5:
    replace_name = int(raw_input("Replace one name.  Which one? (1-5): "))

#Deletes the name that needs to be replaced    
del names[replace_name - 1]

#Asks the user to input the new name
new_name = raw_input("New name: ")

#New name is inserted into the list
names.insert(replace_name - 1, new_name)

#Prints out the updated list of names
print "The names are ", names
