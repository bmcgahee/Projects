#Title: Odds Divisible By Three
#Purpose: This program asks the user how many natural numbers they want the computer to search.
#The program displays all of the odd natural numbers that are divisible by 3 and finds the sum of those numbers.

#Initalize the odds and total variables to count and sum up the number of odd numbers that are divisible by 3.
odds = 0
total = 0

#Computer asks the user to input the amount of natural numbers that will be searched.
numbers = int(raw_input("How many natural numbers do you want to search? "))

#While loop executes if user enters in a number less than or equal to zero.
while numbers <= 0:
    numbers = int(raw_input("How many natural numbers do you want to search? "))
    
print "Here are odd the numbers from 1 to " + str(numbers) + " that are divisible by 3"

#For loop searches all odd numbers that are divisible by 3, displays them and finds their sum.
for i in range(1, numbers + 1):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 2 == 1:
        print i
        odds += 1
        total += i

#Prints the amount of odd numbers that are divisible by 3 and their sum.
print "The total amount of odd numbers from 1 to " + str(numbers) + " that are divisible by 3 is: " + str(odds)
print "The sum of the odd numbers from 1 to " + str(numbers) + " that are divisible by 3 is: " + str(total)
