#Date: 8/18/2015
#Purpose:  Press Your Roll is a game that lets you play a risk and reward rolling dice game where you roll two dice.
#Here are the ground rules:
#You can have up to 12 rolls in the game.
#If you roll any number besdies 7 or 12 you get points for that number rolled.
#If you roll a 7 or 12, your score goes back to 0.
#After each roll, you can choose to roll again or quit.
#Computer totals your score at the end of the game.

#Import random and time
import random, time

#Declare global and initialize variables
global score
global roll
score = 0
roll = 0

#Define function gameRules to state the rules of the game
def gameRules():
    print("Your score begins at 0.  You roll two dice.")
    print("If the sum of the two dice is any number besides a 7 or 12 you get points for the number rolled.  You can choose to roll again if you like or quit.")
    print("You have up to 12 rolls to get the highest score possible.")

#Define function startGame to begin the game
def startGame():
    print("Welcome to Press Your Roll!  Let's begin the game.")

#Define function rollDice to play the game
def rollDice():
    global score
    print("Let's roll the dice!")
    #10 second delay
    time.sleep(10)
    #Two random dice are rolled
    dice1 = random.randint(1, 6)
    dice2 = random.randint(1, 6)
    #Sum of the first and second die
    add = dice1 + dice2
    #If sum is not 7 nor 12 then that sum is added to the score and tells the player the number rolled and their current score
    if add != 7 and add != 12:
        score = score + add
        print("You rolled a: " + str(add))
        time.sleep(5)
        print("Your current score is: " + str(score))
    #If the sum is either a 7 or 12 then the player knows what number he/she rolled and their score goes to zero
    else:
        score = 0
        print("You rolled a: " + str(add))
        print("Your current score is: 0")


#Define function endGame to end the game
def endGame():
    print("Thank you for playing. Goodbye!")
    quit

#Start the game

print("This is how the game works.")
#Five second delay 
time.sleep(5)
#States the game rules

#Fifteen second delay
time.sleep(15)
#Rolls the dice
rollDice()
#While loop executes as long as the player wants to continue playing and is before or on roll 12
while roll <= 10:
    #Asks the player if he/she wants to roll again
    rollMore = input("Roll again? Enter a 'y' for YES or a 'n' for NO ")
    #If player says "no" then the game ends
    if rollMore == 'n':
        break
    elif rollMore == 'y':
    #If player says "yes" then the game continues
        rollDice()
    else:
        break
    #Increment the roll counter by 1
    roll = roll + 1

#States the player's final score at the end of the game and the game is over
