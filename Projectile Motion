#Title: Projectile Motion
#Purpose: This program asks the user to enter the initial velocity and angle of a projectile.
#The program calculates the time when maximum height occured, the maximum height, and the horizontal range of the projectile.

#Import math and time modules.
import math
import time

#Ask user to input initial velocity and angle.
v0 = int(input("Enter initial velocity in meters per second: "))
angle = int(input("Enter angle in degrees: "))

#Convert angle from degrees to radians.
rad = (angle * math.pi)/180

#This is the gravity constant
g = 9.8

#Calculates initial velocity in both the x and y directions.
v0x = v0*math.cos(rad)
v0y = v0*math.sin(rad)

#This is the time when maximum height occured and the total flight time.
t = float(v0y)/g
tRound = round(t, 2)
flightTime = round(2*t, 2)

#Here are the formulas for maximum height and horizontal range.
maxHeight = round(v0y*v0y/float(2*g), 2)
horizRange = round(v0*v0*2*math.sin(rad)*math.cos(rad)/float(g))

#Prints out the stats of the projectile with a 5 second delay.
print("Here are the stats of the projectile..." + "\n")
time.sleep(5)
print("The maximum height occured at " + str(tRound) + " seconds.")
print("The total flight time is " + str(flightTime) + " seconds.")
print("The maximum height was " + str(maxHeight) + " meters.")
print("The horizontal range was " + str(horizRange) + " meters.")
