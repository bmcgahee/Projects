#Title: Pyramid Builders
#Purpose:  These functions create silly, but cool pyramids.

#Import the time module
import time

#Star Pyramid function builds a pyramid of stars using the time.sleep() for a delaying effect.
#Function tells you how many seconds it took to build the star pyramid.
def starPyramid():
   total = 0
   for i in range(1, 11):
      time.sleep(i)
      print("*" * i)
      total += i
   print("You just built a star pyramid!")
   print("The star pyramid was built in " + str(total) + " seconds.")

#Dollar Pyramids function builds two pyramids of dollar signs using the time.sleep() for a delaying effect.
def dollarPyramids():
    print("Watch the dollars fall...")
    time.sleep(5)
    for i in range(11, -1, -1):
        print("$" * i)
    print("Now watch the dollars rise...")
    time.sleep(5)
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print("$" * i)
    print("That was fun.  Now I feel richer!")

#Polar Pyramid function builds a pyramid of positive and negative signs or electric charges and uses the time.sleep() for a delaying effect.
#Function also calculates the number of positive and negative charges in the polar pyramid.
def polarPyramid():
    print("Time to sprinkle some electric charges in the air.")
    time.sleep(5)
    positive = 0
    negative = 0
    j = 1
    k = 1
    for i in range(1, 11):
        time.sleep(2)
        if i % 2 != 0:
            print("+" * i)
            positive += 2*j - 1
            j += 1
        else:
            print("-" * i)
            negative += 2*k
            k += 1
    print("There were " + str(positive) + " positive charges" + " and " + str(negative) + " negative charges" + " in the polar pyramid.")
    print("Benjamin Franklin would have loved this!")
