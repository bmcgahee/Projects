# Projects
This repository contains projects that I have worked on during software development boot camp at The Tech Academy, projects, and coding exercises I have completed outside of boot camp.  

Below are some of my favorite projects:

#1:  Rock, Paper, Scissors 
     Language: Python
     Description:  This programs allows you to play 10 sets of rock, paper, scissors against the computer.  The program keeps up
     with your score and the computer's score.  At the end of the game, the program tells who wins.  
     
#2:  Projectile Motion
     Language: Python
     Description:  This program asks the user to enter in the initial velocity and angle respect to the ground and calculates 
     the time when maximum height occured, the maximum height, and the horizontal range of the projectile.  
     
#3:  File Transfer
     Language: Python
     Description:  This GUI program asks the user if he or she wants to check and/or transfer files from one folder to another.
     The user can select which folder the files need to be transferred from and the folder the files needs to transferred to.
     After the files are transferred, the user is provided with some information such as a letter assigned for the file 
     transfer, the source folder, the destination folder, and the time stamp when the file transfer occured.
