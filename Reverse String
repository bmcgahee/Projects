#Title: Reverse String
#Purpose: This program asks the user to input a string, reverses the string, and prints the reversed string.

#Create empty result string variable
result = ""
#Program asks user to enter in any string.
string = raw_input("Please enter any string: ")
#For loop starts at the last character of the string and ends at the first character of the string and stores it in the result string.
for i in range(len(string) - 1, -1, -1):
    result += string[i]
#Prints the result string.
