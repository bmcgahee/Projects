#Title:  ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS
#Date: 8/22/2015
#Purpose:  This program allows you to 10 sets of rock, paper, and scissors against a computer.
#The program keeps up with your score, the computer's score, and tells who won the game at the end.

#Import random, time, and easygui modules.
import random
import time
import easygui as e

#Define rock, paper, scissors array.
gamePlayChoices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

#Set plays and sets values that will be used in the main (while) loop.
plays = 1
sets = 10

#Initialize computer and player scores.
computerScore = 0
playerScore = 0

#Introduction to the game using sleep method for time delay between messages.
#Host introduces himself and explains the rules of the game.
