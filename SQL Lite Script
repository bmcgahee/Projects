#Purpose:  This program uses sqlite3 to connect to a SQL database called Rosterbase and creates a table called ROSTER
#that inserts fictional characters with attributes such as Name, Species, and IQ.
#The program also executes a SQL query to update the ROSTER table, plus filters and displays specific records from that table.

#Import sqlite3 and abbreviate it as lite
import sqlite3 as lite
#Import system
import sys

#Connect to the database named Rosterbase
con = lite.connect('Rosterbase.db')

#With the connection, do the following below
with con:
    #Define a connection cursor
    cur = con.cursor()
    #Drop table ROSTER if it exists
    cur.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ROSTER")
    #Create table ROSTER
    cur.execute("CREATE TABLE ROSTER(Name TEXT, Species TEXT, IQ INT)")
    #Insert 3 records into ROSTER 
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO ROSTER VALUES('Jean-Baptiste Zorg', 'Human', 122)")
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO ROSTER VALUES('Korben Dallas', 'Meat Popsicle', 100)")
    cur.execute("INSERT INTO ROSTER VALUES('Ak''not', 'Mangalore', -5)")
    #Update ROSTER by changing Korben Dallas' species to Human
    cur.execute("UPDATE ROSTER SET Species = 'Human' WHERE Name = 'Korben Dallas'")

#With the connection, do the following below
with con:
    #Define a connection cursor
    cur = con.cursor()
    #Select all records whose species is Human in ROSTER and show only their names and IQs
    records = cur.execute("SELECT Name, IQ FROM ROSTER WHERE Species = 'Human'")
    #For Loop to go through all the Human records
    for r in records:
        #Display all Human records on the screen
        print r
