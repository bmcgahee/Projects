#Purpose:  This program allows you to create a number set of any size, calculate the minimum, maximum, mean, median, range, variance, and standard deviation.

#Import the math and numpy modules
import math
import numpy

#median function returns the median of a data set
def median(numbers):
    return numpy.median(numpy.array(numbers))

#numMin function returns the minimum number of a data set
def numMin(array):
    mini = array[0]
    for i in array[1:]:
        if i < mini:
            mini = i
    return mini

#numMax function returns the maximum number of a data set
def numMax(array):
    maxi = array[0]
    for i in array[1:]:
        if i > maxi:
            maxi = i
    return maxi

#Asks the user how many numbers he or she wants to include in the data set
#Must include at least two numbers in the data set
print "Please include at least 2 numbers in your data set."
number = int(raw_input("How many numbers are in your data set? "))

#Initialize count variable and numSet array
count = 0
numSet = []

#The while loop gets each number inputted by the user and stores them into the numSet array
while count < number:
    value = int(raw_input("Enter number: "))
    numSet.append(value)
    count += 1

#Calculates the mean (average) and median   
mean = sum(numSet) / float(number)
median = median(numSet)

#Initializes the variable i and diff array
i = 0
diff = []

#The while loop calculates the square of the difference between each number in the data set from the mean and stores it into the diff array
while i < number:
    sqDiff = (numSet[i] - mean) * (numSet[i] - mean)
    diff.append(sqDiff)
    i += 1
#Calculates the variance and standard deviation
diffAverage = sum(diff) / float(number - 1)
stdev = math.sqrt(diffAverage)

#Sorts the numbers in the numSet array and stores it in the sortSet array
sortSet = sorted(numSet)

#Calculates the minimum and maximum numbers in the sortSet array
minimum = numMin(sortSet)
maximum = numMax(sortSet)

#Calculates the range of the data set
rangeSet = sortSet[len(sortSet) - 1] - sortSet[0]

#Outputs the data set, minimum, maximum, mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation
print "Here are some stats based on your data set..."
print "Data Set: " + str(sortSet)
print "Minimum: " + str(minimum)
print "Maximum: " + str(maximum)
print "Mean: " + str(mean)
print "Median: " + str(median)
print "Range: " + str(rangeSet)
print "Variance: " + str(diffAverage)
print "Standard Deviation: " + str(stdev)
